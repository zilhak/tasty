# Remote attach

Bring a Workspace from a Tasty running on another machine into your own Tasty as a **mirror**, view it, and operate it. Connection and authentication are left entirely to SSH, so if you can SSH into that machine, you can attach too.

## Concepts

- attach brings in and shows a Workspace from a **remote Tasty that is already running**. It does not open a new remote shell. Tasty must be running on the remote machine (either the GUI or `tasty --headless`).
- The remote Workspace is held **exclusively** by the side that mirrors it. Meanwhile the user on the remote side can see that terminal but cannot type into it (read-only). It comes back when the connection is closed.
- A mirror Workspace carries a sky-blue **REMOTE** tag in the sidebar. It disappears on restart and is not saved.
- The remote Tasty does not need to be on PATH. It is enough that the port file (`~/.tasty/tasty.port`) can be read.

## 1. Create a profile

There are two kinds of profile. Both are stored in `~/.tasty/remote-profiles.toml`.

| Kind | Holds | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `ssh` | **Connection details only** — host · user · port · identity | `tasty tool ssh` connections; referenced by attach profiles |
| `tasty-attach` | The attach spec — the connection (a reference to an ssh profile, or entered directly) plus the remote tasty path · port discovery mode | attach and remote queries use **only this kind** |

Trying to attach directly with an `ssh` profile is refused. Always create one `tasty-attach` profile.

### From the GUI

1. The tools button in the sidebar → **Tools** menu → **Remote connections…**.
2. **Remote profiles** tab → **+ Add profile**. Enter the name · host · user · port · shell and save. If you leave the shell as `auto`, saving connects once over SSH to detect the shell.
   - Hosts already in `~/.ssh/config` can be created directly from the **Local SSH config** section below the tab with **Import as tasty profile**. Only the alias is stored, so changes to the ssh config are followed as they are.
   - Register key files in the **Passkey** tab first, then pick them from the profile's Passkey dropdown. Secret values are referenced only by path in `~/.tasty/passkeys.toml`.
3. **Attach** tab → **+ Add attach**. Enter a name and, under **Connection**, choose **SSH profile** (referencing the one created above) or **Direct (inline)**.
   - **Remote tasty** group: **Executable** (the remote tasty path, default `tasty`) · **Port mode** · **Port file**. If tasty is not on the remote PATH, enter the full path in Executable or set the port mode to `file-unix`.

### From the CLI

```sh
# ssh profile
tasty tool remote-profile add-ssh --name gx10 --host 10.0.0.5 --user me --port 22 --identity ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
tasty tool remote-profile list-local                      # list ~/.ssh/config aliases
tasty tool remote-profile import --from devbox --name devbox   # alias → ssh profile

# tasty-attach profile (references the ssh profile)
tasty tool remote-profile add-attach --name gx10-attach --ssh-ref gx10 \
  --remote-tasty /home/me/tasty/target/release/tasty --port-mode auto

# inspect · edit · remove
tasty tool remote-profile list [--kind ssh|tasty-attach]
tasty tool remote-profile show --name gx10-attach
tasty tool remote-profile edit --name gx10-attach --port-mode file-unix
tasty tool remote-profile detect --name gx10-attach       # actually connect to the remote and verify the port
tasty tool remote-profile remove --name gx10-attach
```

Port modes:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Tries `subcommand` → `file-unix` → `file-windows` in that order |
| `subcommand` | Runs `<executable> port` on the remote to obtain the port |
| `file-unix` | Reads `~/.tasty/tasty.port` on the remote (no tasty execution) |
| `file-windows` | Reads the port file of a Windows remote |

If you pass `--port-file <path>`, that file is read with the highest priority.

To read the IPC port of the instance currently running on the remote machine, run `tasty port` on that machine — this is what port mode `subcommand` calls on the remote.

## 2. Check that the remote is alive

```sh
tasty remote check --profile gx10-attach       # alive: gx10 (port 41234, version …, N workspaces)
tasty remote workspaces --profile gx10-attach  # list of remote Workspaces (id · name · whether occupied)
```

`remote check` only reports alive once it has found the port and actually received a response. A dead instance that left only a port file behind shows as dead. The failure cause is reported as one of four kinds: SSH connection failure / remote instance not running / response could not be parsed / timeout.

Connection attempts do not wait forever — 10 seconds for the SSH connection, 20 seconds per step, 45 seconds total. On a slow link, raise it yourself with something like `--option ConnectTimeout=30` on the ssh profile.

## 3. Attach from the GUI

1. In the sidebar, **right-click the New workspace (+) button** or right-click the empty background → **Add remote workspace**. (If categories are on, it is also in the category header's right-click menu.)
2. Pick a profile under **Attach profiles** on the left. The list of remote Workspaces appears on the right (if there is no response within 20 seconds it stops and shows **Retry**).
3. Pick a Workspace and **Connect**. One that someone else is already attached to is shown as **in use** and cannot be picked.
   - Picking the first row, **New workspace**, creates a Workspace on the remote with a default name and then attaches to it (**Create & connect**). A Workspace created this way stays on the remote.
4. A mirror Workspace with the **REMOTE** tag appears in the sidebar and focus moves to it.

## 4. Attach from the CLI

```sh
tasty tool attach --list                                   # list tasty-attach profiles
tasty tool attach gx10-attach --workspace 3                # mirror the whole Workspace (run in a terminal)
tasty tool attach gx10-attach 57                           # a single Surface only
tasty tool attach gx10-attach 57 --raw                     # wire my terminal directly to the remote Surface (exit with Ctrl+\)
tasty remote attach --profile gx10-attach --workspace 3    # long form of the same thing as tool attach
tasty remote attach --ssh me@10.0.0.5 --workspace 3        # one-off, without a profile
tasty remote new-workspace --profile gx10-attach --name build --cwd /home/me/proj   # create a Workspace on the remote
```

- A Workspace attach mirrors the terminals inside it, including the split structure. Non-terminal Surfaces such as Markdown · HTML only take up their place; their content is not shown (the explorer can only be browsed).
- `--raw` works only at the Surface level.
- Unless you pass `--no-reconnect`, it automatically tries to reconnect when SSH drops.

To bring it up as a mirror Workspace inside a running Tasty window, use "Set up automatic attach on a Workspace" below.

## 5. Set up automatic attach on a Workspace

If you map a remote target onto a local Workspace, every time you switch to that Workspace Tasty sets up the SSH tunnel and attaches the mirror on its own.

```sh
tasty new workspace --name gx10-dev --ssh-profile gx10-attach --remote-workspace 3
tasty set workspace --id 5 --ssh-profile gx10-attach --remote-workspace 3
tasty set workspace --id 5 --ssh me@10.0.0.5 --remote-workspace 3      # without a profile
tasty set workspace --id 5 --clear-mapping                              # remove the mapping
```

- `--remote-workspace` is the remote Workspace **ID**. Look it up with `tasty remote workspaces`.
- A mapped mirror keeps the Workspace and its scrollback as they are when the connection drops and reconnects in the background (retrying with intervals growing from 0.5 seconds up to 30 seconds; at 30-second intervals when the remote is occupied by someone else). After 20 failures it stops and notifies you with a toast — leaving that Workspace and coming back triggers one more attempt immediately.

## What you can do inside a mirror

- Keyboard input · mouse go straight to the remote terminal. The remote re-lays out to match the size of your Pane.
- Splits, new Tabs, closing · moving Tabs, and Surface conversion are **executed on the remote** and the result is reflected in the mirror. Creating a Surface of a type the remote does not have fails with a toast.
- The remote terminal's completion · input-needed indicators (border · badge) also arrive in the mirror as they are.
- Pasting a clipboard image uploads it to the remote and inputs the **remote path**. Text paste works as usual.
- You cannot create child agents in a mirror Workspace with `tasty claude spawn` and the like. Launch them directly on the remote instance.
- Closing the last terminal of a mirror removes the remote Workspace itself and disconnects.

## Releasing the occupation (on the remote side)

When a Workspace in your Tasty has been attached from elsewhere and become read-only, a **Force detach** notice appears on the Surface. You can also detach from the CLI.

```sh
tasty remote attach --force-detach --workspace 3    # release the occupation of this instance's Workspace 3
tasty remote attach --force-detach 57               # Surface 57
```

While the other side's user is attached, attempting a split · new Tab · `spawn` locally in that Workspace is refused with an "occupied" error. Use another Workspace, or force-detach and then proceed.

## Where files received from the remote are stored

Files transferred over the attach channel are stored in `~/.tasty/transfers/`, with a folder cap of 500 MiB. There is no entry in the settings window yet; change it with the CLI.

```sh
tasty settings get-remote-transfer
tasty settings set-remote-transfer --dir ~/Downloads/tasty --max-mb 2000
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| `kind='ssh'` refused | You passed an ssh profile to `--profile`. Create a `tasty-attach` profile and specify that |
| Remote tasty not found | Is Tasty running on the remote? Verify the port with `tasty tool remote-profile detect --name <n>`. If it is not on PATH, specify the executable path or `--port-mode file-unix` |
| Timeout | Host reachability · firewall. ssh profile `--option ConnectTimeout=<seconds>` |
| SSH connection failed | Authentication · host key. First check that `tasty tool ssh <ssh profile>` connects |
| Workspace attach refused | One of the terminals inside it is already occupied by another client. Force-detach on the remote |
| Screen flickers briefly when first attaching | Normal behavior while the remote re-lays out to your Pane size |
