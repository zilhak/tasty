# Plugins

After reading this page you will know what each plugin bundled with Tasty does, and how to install · disable · check permissions with the plugin window and the `tasty plugin` command.

## What a plugin is

Features such as the Markdown viewer, the image viewer and the Claude Code integration are provided not by the Tasty core but by **plugins**. A plugin runs as a separate process, declares what it adds (Surface kinds · tool menu items · `tasty` subcommands · settings pages · file handlers) and which **permissions** it needs, and Tasty accepts its requests only within the granted permissions.

- Plugins are installed in `~/.tasty/plugins/<id>/`, with logs in `~/.tasty/plugins-logs/<id>.log`.
- The bundled plugins are installed automatically on first launch. After that they can be disabled or removed exactly like plugins you installed yourself. A bundled plugin you removed is not reinstalled on the next launch.
- When a plugin is disabled, the Surface kinds · commands · menu items it added disappear with it.

## Bundled plugins

| Plugin | id | What it does | Where you use it |
|---------|-----|---------|---------|
| **Markdown Viewer** | `com.tasty.markdown` | A Markdown Surface that renders `.md` files. Re-reads the file automatically when it changes | Right-click the tab strip > **New Markdown...**, open a `.md` in the explorer, `tasty markdown reload` · `recent` |
| **Image** | `com.tasty.image` | An image viewer and simple paint tool. Steps to the next · previous image in the same folder and saves as PNG | **New Image**, opening an image file, `tasty image open` · `save` · `export` · `next` · `prev` · `paste` · `list` |
| **HTML Viewer** | `com.tasty.html` | A Surface that shows HTML files and URLs in an embedded webview | **New HTML...**, opening an `.html`, `tasty html open` |
| **Clipboard Viewer** | `com.tasty.clipboard-viewer` | A popup that shows what is currently on the clipboard, classified as text · file · image · HTML. Keeps no history | **Tools** > **Clipboard Viewer**, `Ctrl+Shift+H` |
| **Git Viewer** | `com.tasty.git-viewer` | A read-only popup showing the status · log · diff of the repository in the current directory. With several worktrees, pick one on the left | **Tools** > **Git**, keybinding assigned by you |
| **Claude Code** | `com.tasty.claude` | Multi-agent commands that launch Claude Code inside Tasty, spawn child instances, send them messages and get notified on completion | `tasty claude launch` · `spawn` · `tell` … — [Working with Claude · Codex](../agents/claude-codex.md) |
| **Codex** | `com.tasty.codex` | Does the same as above for the Codex CLI | `tasty codex launch` · `spawn` · `tell` … — same page |

How to use each Surface kind is in [Opening files](../using/files.md). There are also demo · experimental plugins that ship only in development builds; they are not included in the distribution.

### Settings added by plugins

In the **Settings** window, plugin pages appear in two places.

- **Appearance** > **Markdown** — The font override for the Markdown Surface only.
- **Appearance** > **HTML** — **Default zoom** (%) · **Color scheme** (follow theme / light / dark) · **Allow remote content** (off by default — blocks external http/https resources) · **Sandbox scripts** (on by default).
- **Plugins** > **Claude Code** — **Spawn child warning threshold** and so on.
- **Plugins** > **Codex** — **Spawn child warning threshold** · **Default approval policy** · **Default sandbox mode**.

The **Configure** button in the plugin window goes to these pages too.

## The plugin window

Press the **Plugins** button at the very bottom of the sidebar. It has three tabs.

### Installed

The **Installed** tab. Pick one from the list on the left and the details appear on the right. **Filter installed…** above the list filters by name.

- **Status** — **Enabled** / **Disabled**, **Running**. If a plugin is enabled but fails to run, a red marker appears with the notice **Failed to connect. Check the plugin's configuration in Settings.**
- The enable toggle — Turning it off cleans up the process; turning it on starts it again.
- **Permissions** — The list of permissions this plugin has been granted. Read-only here; it cannot be changed.
- **Commands** — Keybinding commands added by the plugin. Change the keys under **Settings** > **Keybindings** > **Plugins**.
- **Log** · **Install path** · **Open folder**.
- **Configure** — Goes to the plugin's page in the settings window.
- **Uninstall** — Deletes the install folder. For a plugin with the **built-in** badge, one more warning appears saying it will not be installed automatically on the next launch either.

### Attention

The **Attention** tab. Plugins whose registration was rejected or that failed to run are collected here with the reason.

| Shown | Meaning | What to do |
|------|----|------|
| **Signature not trusted** | Signed with a key not in the trust list | Confirm the source, compare with **Copy fingerprint**, and if you trust it, **Re-approve** |
| **Signature invalid** | No signature, or verification failed | Get a correct package from the distributor |
| **Permissions changed** | An update changed the required permissions | Read the **newly requested** list and **Re-approve** |
| **Runtime error** | Enabled but failed while running | Check the **Log** |

### Add plugin

The **Add plugin** tab.

1. In **Plugin folder path**, enter a folder containing `tasty-plugin.toml`, or pick one with **Find plugin folder…**.
2. Press **Verify** and **Plugin information** previews the name · version · description and the **required permissions**.
3. Press **Add**.
4. If the plugin is not signed with a verified key, the **Unknown source plugin** confirmation appears. If you check the fingerprint and proceed, that key is recorded in the trust list and you are not asked again. A plugin without its signing key file (`tasty-plugin.toml.pub`) cannot be registered, so ask the distributor for it.

Installing grants the permissions written in the manifest as they are. Read the permission list at the preview step before deciding.

## Permissions

A plugin declares the permissions it needs in advance, and Tasty rejects any request without a granted permission. Common names and their meanings:

| Permission | What it allows |
|------|-------------|
| `surface.read` · `surface.write` | Reading the Surface list · state, creating · changing Surfaces |
| `fs.read` · `fs.write` | Reading · writing files |
| `clipboard.read` · `clipboard.write` | Reading · writing the clipboard |
| `terminal.spawn` · `terminal.write` · `terminal.read` | Creating terminals, sending key input, reading output |
| `notification` | Showing notifications |
| `process.spawn` · `network` | Running external processes, network |
| `ui.tool_item` · `ui.popup` · `ui.settings_page` | Adding tool menu items, popups, settings pages |
| `file_handler.define` · `file_handler.handle:<kind>` | Defining file-kind detection rules, being the one that opens files of that kind |
| `memory.read` · `memory.write` · `memory.secret` | Access to the agent memory store |
| `agent` · `approval` · `telemetry` | Agent collaboration · approval gates · telemetry |

Permissions granted to the bundled plugins:

| Plugin | Permissions |
|---------|------|
| Markdown Viewer | `surface.read` `surface.write` `fs.read` `file_handler.define` `file_handler.handle:markdown` `ui.settings_page` `ui.popup` |
| Image | `surface.read` `surface.write` `clipboard.read` `fs.read` `fs.write` `file_handler.define` `file_handler.handle:image` |
| HTML Viewer | `surface.read` `surface.write` `file_handler.define` `file_handler.handle:html` `ui.settings_page` |
| Clipboard Viewer | `clipboard.read` `ui.popup` `ui.tool_item` |
| Git Viewer | `ui.popup` `ui.tool_item` `fs.read` |
| Claude Code | `surface.read` `surface.write` `terminal.spawn` `terminal.write` `terminal.read` `fs.read` `fs.write` `notification` `telemetry` `agent` `ui.settings_page` `completion_strategy.define` `memory.read` |
| Codex | `surface.read` `surface.write` `terminal.spawn` `terminal.write` `terminal.read` `fs.write` `notification` `ui.settings_page` `completion_strategy.define` |

Removing or restoring individual permissions is done only from the CLI (below).

## The `tasty plugin` command

Use it from a terminal while Tasty is running. The output is JSON.

| Command | What it does |
|------|---------|
| `tasty plugin list` | The id · version · enabled · running state of installed plugins |
| `tasty plugin show <id>` | The full manifest · permissions · commands · running state |
| `tasty plugin install <folder>` | Installs from a folder containing `tasty-plugin.toml`. Grants the manifest permissions as they are |
| `tasty plugin remove <id>` | Removes it |
| `tasty plugin enable <id>` · `disable <id>` | Enables · disables it |
| `tasty plugin logs <id> [--follow]` | Prints the log. `--follow` keeps showing new lines (stop with `Ctrl+C`) |
| `tasty plugin permissions <id>` | The permissions the manifest requires and those actually granted |
| `tasty plugin grant <id> <permission>` · `revoke <id> <permission>` | Grants · revokes one permission. Only permissions declared in the manifest can be granted |
| `tasty plugin doctor <id>` | Diagnoses the manifest — whether it has rules this version of Tasty does not understand |
| `tasty plugin upgrade-builtins [--force] [--restore-removed <id>]` | Realigns the bundled plugins with the bundled version. `--restore-removed` brings back a bundled plugin you removed |

```sh
tasty plugin list
tasty plugin permissions com.tasty.git-viewer
tasty plugin disable com.tasty.clipboard-viewer
tasty plugin logs com.tasty.markdown --follow
```

Example output of `tasty plugin permissions com.tasty.git-viewer`:

```json
{
  "granted": ["ui.tool_item", "fs.read", "ui.popup"],
  "id": "com.tasty.git-viewer",
  "manifest": ["ui.popup", "ui.tool_item", "fs.read"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|------|-----------|
| Markdown · image · HTML files do not open inside the terminal | Whether that plugin is **Enabled** in the plugin window. When it is off, the Surface kind itself does not exist |
| **Clipboard Viewer** · **Git** are missing from the Tools menu | The two plugins are disabled or have landed in **Attention** |
| A plugin's status is red | The **Log** button or `tasty plugin logs <id>` |
| I want to bring back a bundled plugin I removed | `tasty plugin upgrade-builtins --restore-removed <id>` |
| A plugin landed in **Attention** after an update | Its required permissions changed. Read the list and **Re-approve** |
