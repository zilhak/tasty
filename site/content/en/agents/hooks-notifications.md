# Hooks, notifications and webhooks

This page covers **hooks**, which run a command automatically when something happens in a terminal (process exit, specific output, bell); **notifications**, which tell a person; and **webhooks**, which wake Tasty over HTTP from outside. Combining the three lets you build automations like "notify me when the build finishes" with the CLI alone.

## Surface hooks

Run a shell command when an event occurs on a specific Surface (terminal).

```sh
tasty set hook --surface 42 --event process-exit --command "tasty notify 'Shell exited'"
tasty set hook --surface 42 --event 'output-match:error\[E\d+\]' --command "tasty notify \"$TASTY_HOOK_MATCHED_TEXT\""
tasty set hook --surface 42 --event idle-timeout:30 --command "tasty notify 'No output for 30 seconds'" --once
tasty list hooks [--surface 42]
tasty unset hook --hook <HOOK_ID>
```

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `process-exit` | When the shell process exits |
| `bell` | When a bell (`\a`) is received |
| `notification` | When a terminal notification sequence (OSC 9/99/777) is received |
| `output-match:<regex>` | When a **completed line** of output matches the regex |
| `idle-timeout:<secs>` | When there has been no output for N seconds (1-second granularity, re-armed when new output arrives) |
| `command-completed` | When one command finishes inside the shell (requires bash/zsh shell integration) |
| `command-completed:<code>` | Only commands that finished with that exit code (e.g. `command-completed:1` = failed commands) |
| `claude-idle` / `needs-input` / `codex-idle` | Events emitted by the Claude Code / Codex plugins ([Claude and Codex](claude-codex.md)) |

- Add `--once` and the hook is removed automatically after firing once. By default it stays.
- Hook commands run in the background and do not block terminal input.
- `command-completed` never fires without shell integration. A guidance banner appears once on Surfaces that lack shell integration.

Event information reaches the command through environment variables.

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `TASTY_HOOK_EVENT` | The event string you registered (`bell`, `output-match:…`, etc.) |
| `TASTY_HOOK_SURFACE_ID` | ID of the Surface where the event occurred |
| `TASTY_HOOK_MATCHED_TEXT` | The whole line that actually matched in `output-match` |
| `TASTY_HOOK_EXIT_CODE` | Exit code for `command-completed` |
| `TASTY_HOOK_IDLE_ELAPSED_SECS` | Seconds since the last output for `idle-timeout` |

## Global hooks

Run on a time condition, independent of any Surface.

```sh
tasty set global-hook --condition interval:60 --command "df -h > ~/disk.log" --label "Disk log"
tasty set global-hook --condition once:300 --command "tasty notify '5 minutes passed'"
tasty list global-hooks
tasty unset global-hook --hook <HOOK_ID>
```

| Condition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `interval:<secs>` | Repeat every N seconds |
| `once:<secs>` | Run once after N seconds, then delete |

## Hook handlers (reusable actions)

Instead of `--command`, you can attach a pre-registered **hook handler** by name. The same handler is shared by several hooks and webhooks.

```sh
tasty hook-handler list                                     # registered handlers (host / plugin / user)
tasty set hook --surface 42 --event bell --handler user/my-handler
tasty hook-handler dispatch --id user/my-handler            # fire by hand to test
tasty hook-handler reload                                   # re-read ~/.tasty/hook-handlers.toml
```

User handlers are added and edited in the **Settings** › **Handlers** › **Hook Handlers** tab. Saving writes them to `~/.tasty/hook-handlers.toml`, and you can also write the file directly (apply with `tasty hook-handler reload`).

```toml
[[handler]]
id = "user/notify-fail"
source = "hook"          # hook | webhook | any — which triggers may use this handler
[handler.action]
kind = "shell_command"
command = "tasty"
args = ["notify", "Command failed", "--title", "hook"]
```

With `kind = "ipc_sequence"` it runs a list of Tasty-internal actions (`calls = [{ method = "...", params = {} }]`) instead of a shell.

## Notifications

### Sending

```sh
tasty notify "Build finished"                    # the title defaults to "Notification"
tasty notify "3 tests failed" --title "cargo test"
tasty list notifications
```

Notification sequences sent by terminal programs (OSC 9 / 99 / 777) and bells are collected as the same kind of notification.

### Where they appear

- **Notification panel** — open it with `Ctrl+Shift+I` (macOS `Cmd+Shift+I`). The newest-first list shows Workspace, title, body, and elapsed time, and **Jump** takes you to that Workspace. Opening it marks everything read; there is also a **Mark all read** button.
- **Surface border** — a blue border on the Surface where the notification occurred. It disappears when you focus that Surface.
- **Sidebar badge** — a count badge on the row of any Workspace that has a Surface needing attention.
- **OS notification** — a system notification when the Tasty window is inactive (limited to once per second).
- **Sound** — when enabled in settings, one system beep per notification.

### Settings

The **Settings** › **Notifications** tab, or `~/.tasty/config.toml`:

```toml
[notification]
enabled = true        # enable notifications
sound = false         # sound
coalesce_ms = 500     # notification coalescing interval (ms) — merges consecutive notifications from the same source into one

[general]
bell_notification = true   # show bell notifications (turning it off suppresses only the bell toast; bell hooks still fire)
```

### Waiting for a human decision (approval)

Unlike one-way notifications, this is a gate where an agent **waits** for the user's response before a dangerous action.

```sh
ID=$(tasty approval request --title "Run the prod DB migration?" --severity danger \
      --choices "approve:Run,deny:Abort:1" --timeout-ms 600000)
tasty approval await --id "$ID"            # wait until a response arrives, print the result as JSON
```

- A popup appears and a notification goes out as well. The user answers by clicking a popup button, pressing number keys `1`~`9` in the popup (in choice order), or with `tasty approval respond --id <ID> --choice approve`.
- `--severity info` sends only a notification with no popup; `warn`/`danger` show a popup plus a notification. `danger` must be answered by the user directly.
- The popup does not close on Esc (to prevent bypassing). Query with `tasty approval list` / `get` / `history`.

## Webhooks (outside → Tasty)

Let CI or other services send an HTTP request to trigger an action inside Tasty. Tasty opens one designated port and issues an unguessable URL for each webhook.

### Port settings

```sh
tasty webhook config                # current port and whether it is bound
tasty webhook config --port 28429   # change the port — applied after restart
```

- The settings file is `~/.tasty/webhooks.toml`. On first run, `28429` is written as the default.
- If the port is empty or the bind fails, Tasty does not silently switch to another port; it only emits a warning (toast). Fix the port and restart.
- To accept requests from outside, open router forwarding and the firewall yourself. Leave HTTPS to a reverse proxy in front.

### Registering

```sh
# attach to a registered handler
tasty webhook register --method POST --handler host/notify --persistent

# define the action inline — pull values from the body with ${body.x}
tasty webhook register --method POST \
  --sequence '[{"method":"notification.create","params":{"title":"CI","body":"${body.status}"}}]' \
  --ttl-secs 3600 \
  --auth-location header --auth-key X-Token --auth-token s3cret
```

Registering prints a URL of the form `http://127.0.0.1:28429/<16-character id>`. When calling from outside, replace the host part with the real address.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--method <M>` | Allowed HTTP method (repeatable, default POST) |
| `--handler <id>` or `--sequence <json>` | Exactly one of the two is required |
| `--persistent` | Kept across restarts (by default it disappears on restart) |
| `--ttl-secs <secs>` / `--count <N>` | Time limit / call count limit (one of the two) |
| `--auth-location query\|bearer\|body\|header` + `--auth-token` (+ `--auth-key`) | Optional authentication. No auth if not set |

Check the available handler ids with `tasty hook-handler list`. `--sequence` is a JSON list of Tasty-internal actions (send a notification, send text, etc.) written in order.

### Responses and management

The caller receives only a status code and a fixed phrase — internal results are never returned.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 `received` | Accepted (the action runs in the background) |
| 401 | Authentication failed |
| 404 | Unknown URL |
| 405 | Method not allowed |
| 410 | Time or count limit expired |
| 429 | The same source failed 20 or more times in 10 seconds and is blocked for 60 seconds |

```sh
tasty webhook list
tasty webhook info --id <ID>
tasty webhook unregister --id <ID>
tasty webhook sweep                 # clean up expired webhooks in one go
```

Webhooks cannot run shell commands directly (Tasty-internal actions only). If you need a shell, chain them: webhook → notification → Surface hook.

## Combined example: notify when a long build finishes

```sh
tasty set hook --surface 42 --event command-completed --once \
  --command 'if [ "$TASTY_HOOK_EXIT_CODE" = 0 ]; then tasty notify "Build succeeded" --title build; else tasty notify "Build failed ($TASTY_HOOK_EXIT_CODE)" --title build; fi'
tasty send text "cargo build --release\r" --surface 42
```

`command-completed` fires for every exit code; append a single integer, as in `command-completed:0`, and it fires only for that code. The actual exit code reaches the hook command through the `TASTY_HOOK_EXIT_CODE` environment variable.
