# Settings

After reading this page you will know how the settings window is organised, what each tab contains, and how the same content is stored in `~/.tasty/config.toml`. Keybindings and themes are covered separately in [Keybindings](keybindings.md) · [Themes](themes.md).

## Opening the settings window

Press the **Settings** button at the very bottom of the sidebar, or press `Ctrl+,`.

- Seven top tabs: **General** · **Terminal** · **Appearance** · **Keybindings** · **Handler** · **Misc** · **Plugins**.
- The list on the left holds that tab's sections. Typing into **Filter sections…** above it filters the list. Switching tabs clears the filter text.
- Changes are written to the file and applied on screen only when you press **Save**. **Cancel** discards them all. There is no close button in the header.
- Only a **Language** change requires restarting Tasty after saving.

## Entries by tab

### General

| Section | Entries |
|------|------|
| **General** | **Restore layout on startup** · **Restore surface content on restart** (terminal scrollback) · **Workspace categories (folders)** · **Next/prev workspace crosses categories** · **Close behavior** (Ask / Minimize to background / Quit) · **Wheel scroll distance** (10-200pt, default 50) - how far one wheel notch scrolls, applied the same everywhere in the window · **Language** (English / 한국어 / 日本語 plus any [language pack](#adding-a-language-language-packs) you install) |
| **Notifications** | **Notifications enabled** · **Sound** · **Coalesce interval (ms)** |
| **Accessibility** | **Reduced motion** (turns off toast and overlay fades, the loading spinner's rotation, and the modal shake) · **Show modifier key hints** |
| **Overlay** | **Toast duration** (1~10 seconds) |
| **Remote transfer** | **Save folder** (default `~/.tasty/transfers/`) · **Maximum size** (MiB) — where files received from a remote Workspace are saved |
| **Display** (macOS only) | **Alt key display** · **Option key display** · **Shift key display** — choose text or symbols for keybinding notation |
| **Permissions** (macOS only) | **Full Disk Access** · **Screen recording** status and a link to open System Settings |

### Terminal

| Section | Entries |
|------|------|
| **General** | **Shell** · **Startup command** · **Scrollback lines** (default 10000) · **Confirm close running process** · **Inherit working directory** · **Reverse-screen flash (DECSCNM)** · **Show bell notification** · **Link click modifier** (Ctrl / Alt / None) · macOS: **Use Option as Meta** · Windows: **Shell mode** |
| **Mouse Capture** | **Show mouse-capture hint** · **Disable mouse capture for these programs** · **Suppress the capture hint banner for these programs** — process names or patterns such as `ht*` |
| **TUI** | **Allow clipboard read (OSC 52)** — off by default. When on, programs inside the terminal can read the clipboard |
| **Performance** | **Targeted PTY polling** · **Scrollback disk swap** — both take effect after a restart |

If you set **Link click modifier** to **None**, a plain click opens links and cannot be told apart from text selection. The meaning of the mouse capture entries is in [Working in the terminal](../using/terminal.md).

### Appearance

| Section | Entries |
|------|------|
| **Theme** | The theme card list — [Themes](themes.md) |
| **Colors** | Override the current theme's colours entry by entry — [Themes](themes.md) |
| **General** | **Default Font Settings**: **Font family** · **Custom font file** · **Font size** (default 14) · **Line height** · **Font DPI scaling** (Auto / Fixed). Plus **Ligatures** · **Background opacity** |
| **Display** | **UI Scale** — Small / Medium / Large |
| **Tasty** | App chrome colours — **Accent** · **Sidebar background** · **Active tab indicator** (Underline / Fill / Dot) |
| **Terminal** | The terminal Surface's **Focused background** · **Unfocused background** and font override |
| **Explorer** | Explorer-only font override |
| **Markdown** · **HTML** | Pages added by plugins — the Markdown font override, and the HTML viewer's **Default zoom** · **Color scheme** · **Allow remote content** · **Sandbox scripts** |

For fonts, the defaults under **General** apply to terminal · Markdown · explorer all at once, and turning off **Use default** in a section lets only that type use different values. With **Font DPI scaling** set to **Auto**, the physical size of the text stays the same across monitors; with **Fixed**, the pixel size stays the same, so text gets smaller on high-resolution monitors.

### Keybindings

Covered in [Keybindings](keybindings.md).

### Handler

The tables that decide how to "identify what kind of file it is" when opening a file, and "what to open it with". Markdown · images · HTML open on their own with the defaults, so you rarely need to touch this.

- **File Extension Mapping** — Priority when several detectors claim the same extension.
- **File Detectors** — Rules that identify a file's type by extension · path pattern. You can add your own rules.
- **File Handlers** — Which Surface opens an identified type, or whether to hand it to the OS default app.
- **Hook Handlers** — Shell commands to run when a hook · webhook event arrives. [Hooks · notifications · webhooks](../agents/hooks-notifications.md).

These tables are stored not in `config.toml` but in `~/.tasty/file-handlers.toml` and `~/.tasty/hook-handlers.toml`.

### Misc

- **Scripts** — Register Lua scripts to run from a keybinding or an event ([Lua scripts](scripts.md)). Enter the file path (for example `~/.tasty/scripts/my-script.lua`) and a display name; attach the keybinding under **Keybindings** > **Run Scripts**. If the file changes after registration, a **changed** marker appears and you are asked to confirm on the next run.
- On Windows a **Tastyrc** section is added. On other OSes this tab holds only Scripts.

### Plugins

Settings pages added by plugins are collected here. In a default install there are **Claude Code** and **Codex** pages — [Plugins](../plugins/index.md).

## Adding a language (language packs)

Tasty ships with three languages: English, 한국어 and 日本語. Any other language comes
from a **language pack** you place yourself; it then appears in the language list
alongside the built-in ones.

### Writing a pack

Create a folder named after the language code under `~/.tasty/lang/`, and put a
`pack.toml` inside it. For French that is `~/.tasty/lang/fr/pack.toml`.

```toml
[meta]
name = "Français"          # name shown in the language list (without it, the folder name is shown)

[font]                     # required — use exactly one of the four below
builtin = true             # the built-in font already covers the characters you use
# file = "fonts/x.ttf"     # a font file shipped inside the pack folder
# family = "Noto Sans"     # a font family installed on the machine
# candidates = ["fonts/x.ttf", "Noto Sans"]   # tried in order, first hit wins

[button]                   # from here on, the text you are translating
ok = "OK"
cancel = "Annuler"
```

- **`[font]` cannot be left out.** Text without a font promise can render as □, so
  the person writing the pack has to say which font it expects.
- **You do not have to translate everything.** Anything you leave out shows in
  English. Leaving a value empty (`""`) also counts as "not translated" and shows
  in English — you never end up with a blank label.
- Entry names (`[button] ok` and so on) follow the same layout as the language
  files that ship with Tasty. Copying one of those is the quickest start.
- Text containing `{}` has a value filled in at runtime. **Keep the same number of
  them** — drop one and that value disappears, add one and a literal `{}` shows up
  on screen.

### Command-line help is translated too

`tasty --help` and the other terminal help screens come out in the language you
picked. In a language pack, that text lives under `[cli.help]`.

```toml
[cli.help._root]
about = "Émulateur de terminal accéléré par GPU"

[cli.help._root.new]
about = "Créer une ressource"
```

- Here too, **you do not have to translate everything.** Commands you leave out
  keep their English description and simply appear alongside the translated ones.
- The help frame itself — `Usage:`, `Options:`, `Commands:` — is still English.

### Selecting it

The pack appears in Settings › **General** › **Language**. Select it, press
**Save**, then restart Tasty.

### Changing only some text of a built-in language

Place a **single file** instead of a folder — `~/.tasty/lang/ko.toml`, for example.
It overrides just the entries you write, and needs no `[font]`. This works for
English, 한국어 and 日本語 only; a new language placed this way does not show up in
the list.

Leaving a value empty (`""`) counts as "not changed" here too, just as in a pack —
the text that language ships with stays on screen, and you never get a blank spot.

### When it does not work

- **It does not appear in the list** — check that the folder is named after the
  language code, that the file inside is called exactly `pack.toml`, and that
  `[font]` is present. Close and reopen the settings window (the list is read once
  when the window opens). A `pack.toml` may not exceed **2 MiB** — the built-in
  language files are under 100 KiB, so a normal translation never runs into this.
- **English shows up with a warning** — the pack for the selected language was not
  found, or the file is invalid. The warning names the path that was looked for.
  **Your setting is kept**, so fixing the pack and restarting brings that language
  back.
- The full reason is written as one line to `~/.tasty/debug.log`.

## The settings file `~/.tasty/config.toml`

Everything in the settings window is stored in this single file. Missing keys are read as defaults, so you only need to write the ones you need.

```toml
[general]
language = "ko"                  # "en" | "ko" | "ja"
close_behavior = "ask"           # "ask" | "minimize" | "quit"
wheel_line_scroll = 50.0         # how far one wheel notch scrolls (pt), 10-200
restore_layout = true
restore_surface_content = true
scrollback_lines = 10000
inherit_cwd = true
confirm_close_running = true
link_click_modifier = "ctrl"     # "ctrl" | "alt" | "none"
allow_clipboard_read = false
bell_notification = true
workspace_categories_enabled = false
mouse_capture_blacklist = ["htop"]
shell = ""                       # empty = auto-detect
startup_command = ""

[appearance]
theme = "mocha"                  # ~/.tasty/themes/<id>.toml
ui_scale = "medium"              # "small" | "medium" | "large"
ligatures = true
background_opacity = 1.0
active_tab_indicator = "underline"   # "underline" | "fill" | "dot"

[appearance.default_font]
font_family = ""
font_size = 14.0
line_height = 1.0
font_scale_mode = "auto"         # "auto" | "fixed"

[appearance.terminal_font]       # leave empty to follow default_font
font_size = 15.0

[notification]
enabled = true
sound = false
coalesce_ms = 500

[accessibility]
reduced_motion = false

[modifier_hint]
enabled = true

[overlay]
toast_duration_ms = 2000

[performance]
targeted_pty_polling = true
scrollback_disk_swap = false

[remote_transfer]
dir = ""                         # empty = ~/.tasty/transfers/
max_mb = 500

[keybindings]
new_tab = ["alt+t"]              # the rest is in keybindings.md
```

- `[appearance]` also stores the full set of theme colours (`theme_base`) and the values overridden in the Colors tab (`theme_overrides`). Using the settings window is safer than editing these by hand.
- Values from plugin settings pages go into a section keyed by the plugin id, such as `[plugin_settings."com.tasty.html"]`.
- Tasty does not watch this file while running. Hand-edited values are read on the next start, and if you save from the settings window before then, the whole file is rewritten and your hand edits are lost. Quit Tasty before editing the file directly.

Only the remote transfer entries can also be read and written from the CLI.

```sh
tasty settings get-remote-transfer
tasty settings set-remote-transfer --dir ~/incoming --max-mb 1000
```
