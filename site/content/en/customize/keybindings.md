# Keybindings

Use Tasty with shortcuts that feel familiar. Choose a preset or assign your preferred keys to actions you use often. Open **Settings** > **Keybindings** to get started.

## Notation

Tasty stores keybindings by the **physical position of the key**. That is why the same setting is pressed differently on the three OSes.

| Name written in settings | Windows · Linux | macOS |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `ctrl` | Ctrl | Control (⌃) |
| `alt` | Alt | **Command (⌘)** |
| `shift` | Shift | Shift (⇧) |
| `option` | (none) | Option (⌥) |

⌘ on macOS sits in the same place as Alt on Windows · Linux, so the setting value `alt+t` is pressed as `Alt+T` on Windows and `Cmd+T` on macOS. The tables below fill in both columns by this rule.

**Non-Latin keyboards are matched by position too.** Even on a non-Latin layout such as Russian or Greek, keybindings are recognized by the Latin position on the keycap — on a Russian layout, pressing the `H` position (the key that types `Р` in Russian) together with modifiers still triggers the `Ctrl+Shift+H` shortcut. You do not need to re-record shortcuts after switching layouts. The same holds over Markdown and web preview surfaces.

To show the settings screen's notation as the `⌘` `⌥` `⇧` symbols on macOS, change **Alt key display** · **Option key display** · **Shift key display** under **Settings** > **General** > **Display**. The stored values stay the same.

## Default keybindings (Tasty preset)

On a fresh install the **Tasty** preset is applied. When an action has several combinations, all of them work.

### Workspaces · categories

| Action | Windows · Linux | macOS |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| New Workspace | `Alt+N` | `Cmd+N` |
| Close Workspace | `Alt+Shift+W` | `Cmd+Shift+W` |
| Rename Workspace · change subtitle | `F3` · `F4` | `F3` · `F4` |
| Go to Workspace n | `Alt+1` ~ `Alt+9` | `Cmd+1` ~ `Cmd+9` |
| Next · previous Workspace | `Alt+J` · `Alt+K` | `Cmd+J` · `Cmd+K` |
| Go to category n | `Ctrl+Shift+1` ~ `Ctrl+Shift+0` | `Ctrl+Shift+1` ~ `Ctrl+Shift+0` |
| Next · previous category | `Ctrl+Shift+J` · `Ctrl+Shift+K` | `Ctrl+Shift+J` · `Ctrl+Shift+K` |

Category keybindings work only when **Settings** > **General** > **Workspace categories (folders)** is turned on.

### Panes · Tabs · Surfaces

| Action | Windows · Linux | macOS |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Split Pane (left/right / top/bottom) | `Alt+E` / `Alt+Shift+E` | `Cmd+E` / `Cmd+Shift+E` |
| Next · previous Pane | `Ctrl+]` · `Ctrl+[` | `Ctrl+]` · `Ctrl+[` |
| Close Pane | `Ctrl+Shift+W` | `Ctrl+Shift+W` |
| New Tab | `Alt+T` | `Cmd+T` |
| Go to Tab n | `Ctrl+1` ~ `Ctrl+0` | `Ctrl+1` ~ `Ctrl+0` |
| Next · previous Tab | `Ctrl+L` · `Ctrl+H` | `Ctrl+L` · `Ctrl+H` |
| Rename Tab | `F2` | `F2` |
| Close active item (Tab → Pane → Workspace, in that order) | `Ctrl+W` | `Ctrl+W` |
| Restore closed item | `Ctrl+Shift+T` | `Ctrl+Shift+T` |
| Split Surface (left/right / top/bottom) | `Alt+D` / `Alt+Shift+D` | `Cmd+D` / `Cmd+Shift+D` |
| Next · previous Surface | `Alt+]` · `Alt+[` | `Cmd+]` · `Cmd+[` |
| Close Surface | `Alt+W` | `Cmd+W` |
| Convert Surface type (terminal ↔ Markdown, etc.) | `Alt+'` | `Cmd+'` |
| Exit fullscreen stage | `Esc` | `Esc` |

### Terminal · clipboard · explorer

| Action | Windows · Linux | macOS |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Copy | `Ctrl+C` · `Alt+C` · `Ctrl+Shift+C` | `Ctrl+C` · `Cmd+C` · `Ctrl+Shift+C` |
| Paste | `Ctrl+V` · `Alt+V` · `Ctrl+Shift+V` | `Ctrl+V` · `Cmd+V` · `Ctrl+Shift+V` |
| Search | `Ctrl+F` · `Alt+F` | `Ctrl+F` · `Cmd+F` |
| vi copy mode | `Ctrl+Shift+Space` | `Ctrl+Shift+Space` |
| Screenshot to clipboard | `Ctrl+Alt+S` | `Ctrl+Cmd+S` |
| Copy path (explorer) | `Alt+Shift+C` | `Cmd+Shift+C` |
| Cut (explorer) | `Ctrl+X` · `Alt+X` | `Ctrl+X` · `Cmd+X` |
| Select all (explorer) | `Ctrl+A` · `Alt+A` | `Ctrl+A` · `Cmd+A` |
| Refresh · go to parent folder (explorer) | `F5` · `Alt+↑` | `F5` · `Cmd+↑` |
| Zoom in · zoom out · reset zoom | `Ctrl+=` · `Ctrl+-` · `Ctrl+0` (`Alt` also works) | `Ctrl+=` · `Ctrl+-` · `Ctrl+0` (`Cmd` also works) |

`Ctrl+C` copies when there is selected text; otherwise it interrupts the running program as usual.

### Window · tools

| Action | Windows · Linux | macOS |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| New window | `Alt+Shift+N` | `Cmd+Shift+N` |
| Open/close Settings | `Ctrl+,` | `Ctrl+,` |
| Open/close notifications | `Ctrl+Shift+I` | `Ctrl+Shift+I` |
| Open/close DAG list | `Ctrl+Shift+G` | `Ctrl+Shift+G` |
| Hide / collapse sidebar | `Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Ctrl+B` | `Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Ctrl+B` |
| Command palette | `Ctrl+Shift+P` · `Alt+Shift+P` | `Ctrl+Shift+P` · `Cmd+Shift+P` |
| Clipboard Viewer (plugin) | `Ctrl+Shift+H` | `Ctrl+Shift+H` |

### Actions with an empty default

The following have no default combination, either to prevent accidents or because they clash with OS shortcuts. Assign one yourself if you need it.

- **Quit** · **Immediate quit** · **Minimize to background** (the Mac preset includes `Cmd+Q` · `Cmd+M`, the Linux preset `Ctrl+Q`)
- Free combinations for **Next tab** · **Previous tab** (left empty because `Ctrl+Tab` clashes with the OS — the numbered switching `Ctrl+L` · `Ctrl+H` works)
- **Open Markdown** · **Open Explorer** · **Convert to Markdown** · **Convert to Explorer**
- **Apply workspace · tab · pane preset**, **Collapse/expand all categories**
- **Minimize window** · **Maximize/Zoom window** · **Close window**
- The entries in the sidebar **Tools** menu — **Open port scanner** · **Open remote tools** · **Open preset window** · **Open tutorial** · **Open file picker**
- Open Git Viewer (plugin)

## Presets

**Settings** > **Keybindings** > **Preset** offers four. A preset is only a recommended set and is not tied to the OS — you can use the Mac preset on Windows.

| Preset | Based on | Differences from the Tasty preset |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| **Tasty** (default) | Its own | The tables above. Copy · paste · zoom bundle the conventions of all three OSes |
| **Mac** | iTerm2 · Terminal.app | `Cmd`-centred. Settings `Cmd+,` · notifications `Cmd+Shift+I` · sidebar `Cmd+Shift+B` / `Cmd+B` · command palette `Cmd+Shift+P` · copy/paste `Cmd+C` / `Cmd+V` only · quit `Cmd+Q` · background `Cmd+M`. **Close active item** and **Close Workspace** are empty, and close Pane is `Cmd+Shift+W` |
| **Windows** | Windows Terminal | Pane split `Alt+Shift+E` / `Alt+Shift+D`, Surface split `Alt+D` / `Alt+E` · new window `Ctrl+Shift+N` · copy/paste `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` only |
| **Linux** | GNOME Terminal | Same as the Windows preset, but copy/paste/cut `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V` / `Ctrl+Shift+X` · quit `Ctrl+Q` |

To apply one:

1. Click a preset row in the **Settings** > **Keybindings** > **Preset** list. The preset in use is marked **Active**.
2. In the detail view, check the rows that change in the three-column table of **Action** / **Current** / preset.
3. Press **Apply** at the top right. Nothing is saved to the file yet.
4. Press **Save** at the bottom of the window.

Applying a preset resets every keybinding you changed by hand back to the preset value.

## Moving to another computer — Import / Export

**Import / Export**, at the very bottom of the list on the left of **Settings** > **Keybindings** (below the divider), moves your whole keybinding configuration as a single file. General keybindings, number-switch rules, script keybindings and plugin keybindings all go in.

To export:

1. Press **Export…**.
2. Pick a folder and a file name. The default name is `tasty-keybindings-<date>.toml`.
3. Once written, a notification shows the file path. Edits you haven't saved yet are included.

If the file can't be written (for example, the folder is read-only), **The export wasn't written** appears inside the **Export** row. Use **Try again** to write to the same place, or **Choose another location…** to pick somewhere else. While that notice is up, the **Export…** button is disabled.

To import:

1. Press **Import…** and open the file you brought over. Nothing is applied yet — a comparison view opens.
2. Current and imported values sit side by side in four groups: **General bindings** · **Quick switch** · **Script bindings** · **Plugin overrides**. At first only rows that change are shown; **Show all N** at the top right shows everything.
3. Untick the rows you don't want. The tick on a group title turns the whole group on or off.
4. Press **Apply** at the top right. Nothing is saved to the file yet.
5. Press **Save** at the bottom of the window. **Cancel** discards the imported changes too.

Good to know:

- Quick switch moves one axis at a time (Tab · Workspace · Category) — the modifier and the slot keys move together.
- Plugin keybindings that exist only on this computer are not removed just because the file lacks them. Conversely, keybindings for plugins not installed on this computer are not imported, and the comparison view says so in one line.
- If parts of the file had to be skipped (a file written by a newer tasty, actions this version doesn't know), they are listed one per line in a **Read with warnings** box above the comparison. With four or more, three show and the rest open with **Show N more**.
- If you pick something that isn't a keybinding file, you get **This file can't be read as keybindings** instead of the comparison, and nothing changes. Use **Choose another file** to try again.

### Importing a file made on a Mac into Windows or Linux

Keybindings that contain the Mac `Option` key never work on Windows or Linux. If there are any, an **Option bindings need a replacement** card appears above the comparison, and **Apply** stays disabled until every one is settled.

- A regular keybinding — click the slot on the right and press the combination to use instead. To not use it on this computer, press **Leave unbound**.
- A number-switch modifier — choose a replacement modifier combination from the dropdown (it starts empty, showing **Select a modifier**). A modifier can't be left unbound.
- If the combination you choose collides with another action in the file, it is shown under that row (with two or more collisions, a **N conflicts** line comes first at the top of the card), and the **Shortcut already in use** popup appears when you **Apply**. Choosing **Overwrite** clears the other action.

## Changing one keybinding

1. Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`) > **Keybindings**. The sub-tabs on the left are divided by what the action targets — **General** · **Workspace** · **Pane** · **Tab** · **Surface** · **Clipboard** · **Zoom** · **Explorer** · **Run Scripts** · **Preset** · **Plugins** · **Import / Export**.
2. Click the key button of the action you want to change; it turns into **Press key combination...**. Press the combination you want.
3. To add another combination to the same action, press **Add binding**.
4. Pressing `Esc` while recording empties that slot.
5. If the combination is already used by another action, the **Shortcut already in use** popup appears. Choosing **Overwrite** removes the combination from the existing action and moves it to this one.
6. Press **Save**. **Cancel** discards everything.

Recording rules:

- Typing keys such as letters · digits · space register only together with at least one modifier (Ctrl/Alt/Shift). `W` alone is ignored.
- Keys such as `F1`~`F12` · `Tab` · `Enter` register without a modifier.
- `Esc` is reserved for "empty the slot" and cannot be recorded as a keybinding. To restore **Exit fullscreen stage**, whose default is `Esc`, reapply a preset.
- When a plugin keybinding (the **Plugins** sub-tab) overlaps a core keybinding, **the plugin's runs first**.

## Changing the numbered-switching rule

"Go to n" · "next/previous" for Tabs · Workspaces · categories are grouped under a **one modifier + one key** rule. Change it at the bottom of the **Tab** sub-tab and the bottom of the **Workspace** sub-tab.

- The **Tab switch modifier** · **Workspace switch modifier** · **Category switch modifier** dropdowns — defaults `Ctrl` · `Alt` · `Ctrl+Shift`. Changing one changes all ten slots on that axis at once.
- The slot buttons **Tab 1:** ~ **Tab 10:** and so on — press a single key without a modifier (**Press a key (no modifier)...**). For example, changing slot 1 to `Q` makes `Ctrl+Q` go to Tab 1, and the number badge shown on the Tab while the modifier is held changes to `Q` as well.
- **Next tab:** · **Previous tab:** and so on — likewise a single key. Defaults are vi-style `L`/`H` (Tabs), `J`/`K` (Workspaces · categories).
- Choosing **Custom** in the dropdown abandons the rule and records a completely different combination for each slot (such as `Ctrl+Alt+1`). No number badge is shown in this mode. Going back to the rule mode resets that axis to its defaults.

## Keybindings while typing in a popup

While a popup that takes input — the search bar, the file picker, the command palette — **has
focus, keybindings are paused.** This prevents a shortcut such as `Alt+W` from closing a surface while you type into the search bar. If such a popup is merely open and does not
have focus, keybindings work as usual.

To return to terminal controls, use either of these actions.

- **`Esc`** — releases the focused popup. Popups of the kind that close when you click outside
  them close as well; the others stay open and merely lose focus. Other popups that are open
  but not focused are left alone.
- **Click outside the popup** — same result as `Esc`.

While the settings window or the notification panel is open, `Esc` closes that one first.

## Two things that save you from memorising keybindings

- **Modifier key hints** — Hold `Ctrl` · `Alt` · `Shift` and the like for 0.5 seconds or longer (Shift alone: 1.2 seconds) and a list of keybindings starting with that combination appears below the sidebar. It disappears when you let go. Turn it off with **Settings** > **General** > **Accessibility** > **Show modifier key hints**; the panel can be dragged around or resized.
- **Command palette** — `Ctrl+Shift+P` or the **palette** chip in the status bar. Type an action's name and run it with `Enter`. Every action in the Keybindings tab and the global commands of active plugins are searchable.

## Editing the settings file directly

Keybindings are stored in the `[keybindings]` section of `~/.tasty/config.toml`. The values are OS-independent names, so the file can be moved to another OS and used as-is.

```toml
[keybindings]
new_tab = ["alt+t"]
copy = ["ctrl+c", "alt+c", "ctrl+shift+c"]
quit = []                      # empty = no keybinding
tab_switch_modifier = "ctrl"   # combinations such as "ctrl+shift" also work
tab_switch_slot_keys = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0"]
tab_switch_next_key = "l"
tab_switch_prev_key = "h"
```

The `+` key itself is written as `ctrl++` or `ctrl+plus`, `-` as `ctrl+-` or `ctrl+minus`, and `=` as `ctrl+=` or `ctrl+equals`. For editing the file in general see [Settings](settings.md).
