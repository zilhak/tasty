# Troubleshooting

This page is where you look up the cause and the fix by symptom when you get stuck using Tasty. Once you know what gets written where, most problems narrow down to opening a single file.

## Files to check first

All of them live under `~/.tasty/` (on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\.tasty\`).

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `config.toml` | Settings. Values saved from the settings window end up here |
| `tasty.port` | The IPC port number of the running Tasty. Created when Tasty starts |
| `debug.log` | Warning-and-above log of the previous run. Cleared when Tasty starts again |
| `crash-reports/crash-*.log` | Crash reports — version · OS · location · message · backtrace |
| `crash-reports/hang-*.log` | Written automatically when the window freezes for more than 5 seconds |
| `hook-failures.log` | Records of Claude / Codex hooks that failed to reach Tasty |
| `plugins-logs/<plugin id>.log` | Per-plugin logs. Also viewable with `tasty plugin logs <id>` |
| `state.db` | Data the app manages on its own, such as recent files |

If you need more detailed logs, run Tasty from a terminal with the log level raised. The variable is `TASTY_LOG`, not `RUST_LOG`.

```sh
TASTY_LOG=debug tasty 2> tasty.log
```

## Install · first launch

- **Windows: a "Windows protected your PC" warning appears** — the binary is not code-signed. Click **More info → Run anyway**.
- **macOS: it will not open, saying "unidentified developer"** — that is Gatekeeper. Allow it in **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tasty.app` in a terminal.
- **Linux: the AppImage does not run** — it lacks the execute bit or FUSE is missing. Run `chmod +x Tasty-*.AppImage` first; if it still fails, start it with `./Tasty-*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run`.
- **Linux: it does not start, with `GLIBC_2.39 not found`** — your distribution is older than the build baseline (Ubuntu 24.04), for example Ubuntu 20.04 · Debian 11. There is no build for older distributions.
- **Linux `.tar.gz`: it exits saying a library is missing** — `tasty` lists the missing library and exits. Install the packages it names (`libfreetype6` · `libfontconfig1` · `libgtk-3` · `libwebkit2gtk-4.1` and so on). To have them pulled in automatically, use the `.deb` / `.rpm` instead.
- **"No GPU adapter found" appears and it exits** — there is no GPU driver (Vulkan / DirectX 12 / Metal). Install or update the driver. On Linux, Tasty runs GPU-accelerated when `libvulkan1` / `vulkan-loader` is present, and falls back to software rendering when it is not. On a server · VM with no GPU at all, the distributed files cannot run.
- **Windows: "Git Bash not found"** — Tasty uses Git Bash as the shell on Windows. Install Git for Windows, or set the bash path yourself in **Settings** > **Terminal** > **Shell**.
- **It exits right after starting with "Database initialization error"** — read the message body. "The database is locked" means another Tasty is already running. "corrupted" / "schema version mismatch" means you can back up `~/.tasty/state.db`, delete it, and start fresh. Only the recent-files list is lost.
- **You typed `tasty` inside a Tasty terminal but no new window appeared** — run with no arguments inside Tasty, it shows the help instead of opening a new window. For a new window use `tasty new window`; to force the GUI to launch, `tasty --launch`.

The install procedure itself is in [Install](../getting-started/install.md).

## macOS permission prompts

**Symptom** — a series of permission prompts appears right after the first launch. The order is the Downloads · Documents · Desktop folders → (if connected) external · network volumes → screen recording. The window works normally while the prompts are up.

**Cause** — when a command run inside the terminal reads a file, macOS attributes that access to Tasty (Terminal.app · iTerm2 behave the same). Left alone, a prompt would pop up mid-task the first time a new folder is touched and stall the agent, so Tasty asks up front right after startup. Items already allowed · denied are not asked again; only newly mounted volumes get an extra prompt. There is no setting to turn this off — turning it off would not make the prompts disappear, they would just appear sporadically during your work instead.

**How to answer**

| Prompt | If you do not allow it | To change it later |
|---|---|---|
| Folder access (Downloads · Documents · Desktop · volumes) | The prompt appears again, at that moment, from the command that uses the folder | System Settings > Privacy & Security > Files and Folders |
| Screen recording | The `Ctrl+Alt+S` screenshot-to-clipboard feature only shows a "Screen recording permission is required" notice. Once denied, it is not asked again | System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording |

You can see the current state in the **Settings** > **General** > **Permissions** tab (only shown on macOS).

- **A "Grant Tasty Full Disk Access" notice appeared** — it appears once, when Tasty does not seem to have Full Disk Access. The app cannot request this permission itself, so click **Open settings** to open System Settings and add Tasty to the list yourself. Granting it makes the file access prompts (other apps' data · Downloads · Documents · Desktop · volumes) go away. Controlling other apps (Automation) · screen recording are separate permissions, though, and remain. To see the notice again, turn on **Show the Full Disk Access notice at startup** under **Settings** > **General** > **Permissions**. The Full Disk Access state shown in the same tab is an estimate and can be wrong; no feature is blocked by this value.
- **"Tasty would like to access data from other apps" keeps appearing for every app folder** — paths like `~/Library/Application Support/<app>` are asked per app, so they cannot be asked up front. Granting Full Disk Access as above makes them go away.
- **"wants to control another app" appears when you use `osascript`** — the Automation permission must be approved per target app, and Full Disk Access does not cover it. There is nothing Tasty can do in advance.

## The window freezes or crashes

- **The window does not respond to clicks · key input · the CLI at all** — when it freezes for more than 5 seconds, `~/.tasty/crash-reports/hang-*.log` is written automatically. If the file's `Render phase` is `acquire` / `submit` / `present`, the problem is on the GPU driver side — update the driver. Tasty does not recover on its own, so force-quit it and start it again.
- **It exited suddenly** — look at `~/.tasty/crash-reports/crash-*.log`. Attach this file when you report the problem.

## My settings or window layout look like they were reset

- **The settings went back to their defaults** — if `~/.tasty/config.toml` cannot be parsed as TOML, Tasty starts from the defaults. Your original file is not deleted. It is left where it is, and moved next to it as `config.toml.bak` the moment settings are saved over it. Fix that file and rename it back to `config.toml` and your settings come back as they were. Which line failed is written to `~/.tasty/debug.log`.
- **A saved window layout was not restored** — the same applies to a damaged slot file under `~/.tasty/layouts/`. The original is kept beside it as `01.json.bak`.
- **A notification said saving is blocked until you move or delete the `.bak` files** — Tasty tried to move your original aside but all nine slots (`.bak` through `.bak.9`) are already taken, so there is nowhere to put it. It stops saving rather than delete your file, and it stays that way for the whole session. Move or delete the backups you no longer need, then start Tasty again.
- **A notification said the settings file could not be read** — the file is there but Tasty could **not read** it (a permission problem or a disk error). In that case Tasty leaves the file alone and does not save over it, so the defaults on screen never replace your real settings. Fix the permissions or move the file aside, then start Tasty again.

  ```sh
  ls -l ~/.tasty/config.toml ~/.tasty/layouts/
  ```

## The `tasty` command cannot connect

- **`No running tasty instance found (port file not found at …)`** — no Tasty window is running. If the path in the message is not `~/.tasty/tasty.port`, the command is looking at a different home directory (`TASTY_HOME`). The message follows your configured language (`general.language`, English by default), so it is worded differently if you set another one.
- **The port file exists but it cannot connect** — a previous Tasty exited abnormally and left only the port file behind. Make sure Tasty is not running, then delete the file and start it again.

  ```sh
  pgrep -x tasty || rm ~/.tasty/tasty.port
  ```

- **`tasty: command not found`** — inside a terminal that Tasty opened it is on the PATH automatically, but in another terminal app you have to add it yourself. The path for each install method is in [Install location](../getting-started/install.md#install-locations).

## Notifications do not arrive · there are too many

- **OS notifications do not appear** — while the Tasty window is active, no OS notification is sent; you are notified only inside the app, through the panel · border · badge. OS notifications go out only while the window is inactive, and are limited to one per second. Check that **Notifications enabled** under **Settings** > **Notifications** is not turned off. The panel opens with `Ctrl+Shift+I` (macOS `Cmd+Shift+I`).
- **A notification for every bell (`\a`) is noisy** — turn off **Settings** > **Terminal** > **Show bell notification**. In `config.toml`, that is `bell_notification = false` under `[general]`. Bell hooks still fire.
- **There is no sound** — **Settings** > **Notifications** > **Sound** is off by default. Even when it is on, consecutive notifications from the same source within the merge interval are combined into one, so the sound plays only once.

The full list of settings is in [Hooks · notifications · webhooks](../agents/hooks-notifications.md#settings).

## Claude · Codex hooks do not work

**Symptom** — completion notifications from child agents do not arrive. The Surface border · sidebar badge does not light up even after the agent finishes its response. Restoring a Tab or restarting Tasty does not resume the same session. `tasty claude reboot` fails with `claude-session-id meta not set`. The state shown by `tasty claude children` differs from reality.

**Cause** — the hooks are not installed, or an old hook command is still sitting in the settings file after you updated Tasty.

**Fix** — reinstall the hooks. Running it several times does not create duplicates.

```sh
tasty claude install    # ~/.claude/settings.json
tasty codex install     # ~/.codex/config.toml
```

If that still does not help, look at `~/.tasty/hook-failures.log` and `tasty plugin logs com.tasty.claude --follow`. Details are in [Working with Claude · Codex](../agents/claude-codex.md#troubleshooting).

## A plugin has stopped

- **`tasty plugin list` shows enabled but not running** — a plugin that fails to run 3 times within 10 seconds is stopped automatically. Check the cause with `tasty plugin logs <id>`, then start it again with `tasty plugin enable <id>`.
- **A bundled plugin is broken** — copy it again from the bundle with `tasty plugin upgrade-builtins --force`. Plugin data (bookmarks · profiles and so on) is kept.

## I do not know which port my dev server came up on

Open **Listening ports...** from the **Tools** menu in the sidebar. It shows the TCP ports opened by processes started from Tasty terminals, together with the port · process · Workspace · Tab.

- By default only the LISTEN state is shown. If the list is empty and "No ports match the state filter" is displayed, it does not mean there are no ports — use the **State** button on the right of the filter row to turn on other states and click **Apply**.
- To include processes outside Tasty, turn on **Show all (system-wide)**.
- Click a row to select it and use **Copy address** to put `host:port` on the clipboard.
- Add a port to favorites with the star icon and it always stays at the top, surviving restarts (`~/.tasty/port-favorites.toml`).

## Reporting a problem

File it at https://github.com/zilhak/tasty/issues. Including the following gets it resolved faster.

- The output of `tasty --version`, plus your OS · version
- Steps to reproduce
- The matching `crash-*.log` / `hang-*.log` from `~/.tasty/crash-reports/`
- `~/.tasty/debug.log` from right after the symptom (it is cleared on the next start, so copy it first)
