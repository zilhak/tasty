//! `tasty remote ...` subcommand — 원격(SSH) attach 1급 표면.
//!
//! 원칙 1 ②: 원격 attach 는 에이전트의 정당한 행동(다른 호스트의 surface/workspace
//! 를 mirror)이라 release 표면에 노출한다. 로컬 self(loopback) attach 는 사용자 입력
//! 재현 성격이라 `tasty debug attach`(debug 빌드)로 격리한다(`crates/tasty-cli/src/local/debug/attach.rs`).
//!
//! 실제 SSH 터널 + attach 세션 머신은 `crates/tasty-cli/src/local/attach.rs` 의 `run_attach_ssh` /
//! `run_attach_workspace_ssh` 에 공유 보존된다 — 이 네임스페이스는 디스패치만 한다.
