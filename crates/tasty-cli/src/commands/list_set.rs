    /// The answer is one block per population, and the populations differ on
    /// purpose. `queue_before_gate` is measured before the permission gate, so
    /// it also counts requests that were later rejected. `handler_after_gate`
    /// is measured after it, so it counts only requests that ran.
    /// `plugin_round_trip` is how long this instance waited for a plugin to
    /// answer, counting only the requests that were answered at all. `db` is
    /// how long writes took to settle on disk, counting only commits that
    /// succeeded. Do not subtract one block from another: a request can pass
    /// the gate and still be answered before the handler block sees it.
    ///
    /// `connections` is the fifth block and it is not time, it is seats: every
    /// TCP connection attached to this port, including attach and mesh streams
    /// that never send a request. `live` is the only value here that goes
    /// down, `limit` is the ceiling the server enforces and travels with the
    /// values so the two can be read together, and `refused_saturated` counts
    /// connections turned away at that ceiling — before they became requests,
    /// so they appear in none of the four blocks above.
    ///
    /// `connections` also carries one duration, and it is a bound rather than a
    /// measurement: for every connection the accept loop took (`accept_waits`,
    /// which equals `accepted` plus `refused_saturated`), the time since the
    /// accept queue was last seen empty, which the connection's wait in the
    /// operating system's queue can never exceed (`accept_wait_bound_us_sum`,
    /// `accept_wait_bound_us_max`, `accept_wait_bound_us_mean`). The loop
    /// sleeps 100 ms when the queue is empty, so a client that opens a new
    /// connection for every call can lose up to that much before its request is
    /// read, and this is the only block where that time shows.
    ///
    /// Three of those four — `queue_before_gate`, `handler_after_gate` and
    /// `plugin_round_trip` — also carry a `*_hist` with the distribution of
    /// the same observations, because an average and a maximum cannot tell
    /// "everything is slightly slow" from "most are fast and a few are not".
    /// `bounds_us` and `counts` travel together; `counts` is one entry longer
    /// and is not cumulative, so the entries sum to the observation count and
    /// the last one means only that the top bound was passed. Quantiles are
    /// not computed here. `db` is a duration too but has no distribution, and
    /// `connections` has none because its seats are not durations and its one
    /// duration is only a bound.
    ///
    /// `db_pragmas` is the sixth block and it is not a running total at all:
    /// for each SQLite database (`memory_db`, `state_db`) it shows the
    /// connection settings that were requested when the database was opened
    /// next to the values read back from it, because a request such as
    /// journal_mode=WAL can be silently refused. `degraded` is true when any
    /// setting did not take, and for `memory_db` also when the file could not
    /// be opened and the instance runs on an in-memory fallback, in which case
    /// `init_failure` names the cause (it is null otherwise); the database is
    /// still in use. `state_db` is null
    /// when that database is not open in this process, which is always the
    /// case for a headless instance.
    ///
    /// `stream_push` is the seventh block and it counts frames this instance
    /// pushed rather than requests it answered: frames sent to attach and mesh
    /// stream connections. `frames_dropped` counts frames thrown away because a
    /// connection's queue was full while the connection stayed up, and
    /// `clients_lagged_out` counts connections cut for falling too far behind;
    /// both only go up. `backlog` is how many frames are queued right now and
    /// not yet written, summed over the live connections, and `sink_capacity`
    /// is the queue ceiling of one connection to read it against.
    ///
    /// `queue_admission` and `queue_dispatch` are the two ends of the command
    /// queue. `queue_admission` is what is in the queue right now (bytes,
    /// commands, and how many of those this instance injected itself) with the
    /// peak byte count, the requests turned away at the byte ceiling
    /// (`refused_bytes`) or the injected depth ceiling (`refused_depth`), and
    /// the two ceilings (`limit_bytes`, `limit_injected_depth`) to read them
    /// against; a turned-away request never entered the queue, so it appears
    /// in no other block. It is null when this process has no IPC server.
    /// `queue_dispatch` is what was taken out: rounds and how many stopped at
    /// the command or time budget, commands whose deadline passed while they
    /// waited (`expired_before_run`), commands started, and `in_flight`, the
    /// requests running now whose caller is still waiting, with its peak.
    ///
    /// `keyed_requests` counts only requests that carried an idempotency key,
    /// one slot per decision: `executed` (a new key, it ran), `replayed` (the
    /// same request again, the kept answer was returned), `conflicted` (a
    /// different request under the same key, nothing ran), `discarded` (it
    /// ran but its answer was thrown away) and `in_flight` (the same request
    /// was still running and this one joined it). Each request is counted
    /// once. This `in_flight` is not the one in `queue_dispatch`.
    ///
    /// `slow_requests` is the eleventh block and it lists single slow requests
    /// instead of totals: each request whose queue wait, host time and plugin
    /// waits add up to `threshold_us` (100 ms) or more gets one row, oldest
    /// first, up to `capacity` rows. A row carries `request_seq`, a number this
    /// instance gives every request (not the JSON-RPC id and not an event trace
    /// id), the `method`, the `caller`, `queue_wait_us`, `host_us` and, when
    /// the request was forwarded to a plugin, `plugin_hops` with the plugin,
    /// the `host_request_id` that plugin received as its request id, the wait
    /// and the outcome. `admitted` counts every row ever kept, so the rows
    /// pushed out are `admitted` minus the rows shown. A query for this answer
    /// is never kept itself.
    ///
    /// The `host` part of a slow row also carries the answer the caller
    /// actually got: `outcome` is `ok` or `error`, the same words a plugin hop
    /// uses, and `error_code` is the JSON-RPC error code when it is an error,
    /// so a request that expired in the queue before it ran (-32067), a refused
    /// one (-32001) and a normal answer can be told apart from the ring alone.
    /// Both are null while no answer has gone out yet, for example while a
    /// forwarded request is still waiting for its plugin.
    ///
    /// `queue_before_gate.waits` counts the commands whose queue wait was
    /// recorded, at the moment each was taken out; it is the denominator of
    /// `wait_us_mean` and equals the sum of `wait_us_hist.counts`. `commands`
    /// rises only when a round of taking commands out ends, so within one
    /// answer it can trail `waits` by the round still running, which includes
    /// the query itself.
